I'll You'll but life my take take too yours 
I'll You'll but fire musket run through you your 
So attack for next the waiting when you're 
You'd back better no stand there's turning 
The as begins bugle charge sounds the 
But battlefield no on one this wins 
The acrid and breath horses of smell smoke 
As a certain death into plunge you 
Oh oh oh
